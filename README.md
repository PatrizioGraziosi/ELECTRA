# ELECTRA
Open source code from the "GENESIS" project

The ELECTRA code solves the Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) for charge transport using the wave-vector and energy dependent momentum relaxation time approximation. The simulator computes the charge transport coefficients. It considers charge carrier scattering with phonons, ionized dopants, and alloy scattering. 
ELECTRA takes as input the electronic bandstructure and certain scattering parameters as detailed below, and returns the charge transport coefficients.

ELECTRA is written in MATLAB® and makes use of the Parallel Computing Toolbox™. A version ported in C language exists, but it is still under test.

The input instruction file and some input data are reported as examples. The Graphical User Interface to prepare the input instructions will be added shortly.
